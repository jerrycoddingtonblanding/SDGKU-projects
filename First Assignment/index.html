        <P class="backgroundinfo">
I have had a very simple life.  I was born in an <b>extremely</b> small town in South Carolina and spent much of my time playing video games.  I have 1 older brother and 1 younger sister.  The important thing to remember about me is that I <em><b>am absolutely obsessed with gaming.</b> </em>  I met my wife when we were both in college and we have been together ever since.  <del>I did have like one other girlfriend before her.</del>  I have never had any other girl in my life ever...

        <p id="secondparagraph">
I have spent a lot of my life working various odd jobs.  I have done jobs ranging from making/serving <small>disgusting</small> sandwiches<sub>1</sub> to <strong>serving in the Army for 4 years as a combat medic.</strong>  I am currently 32 and now live in Austin, Texas with my wife and our dog and cat.  My main motivation for taking this course is the desire to get a better kind of job to better provide for my current and future family.

        <h3> Final Thoughts</h3>

        <p id="thirdparagraph">
I am very excited to be a part of this program and I look forward to many more excellent classes.  I realize this is going to be on the shorter side in terms of personal content, but I <em>believe</em> that I have utilized enough of what was taught that it shows my dedication.  If not, well then please let me know so I can do better in the future.

            1. The sandwiches were fine but my boss was a piece of crap.
